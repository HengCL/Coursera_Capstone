## Introduction/ Business Problem
Seattle Police Department had been recording all types of vehicular collisions that often times lead to a loss of property and the lives of those involved. The question that can be raised here is as such-"What are the most common causes, in order to prevent road accidents from happening?". This is an attempt to understand the factors and their correlations based on data collected from 2004 to the present. With the results of the analysis, preventive measures could be introduced to the SPD for better enforcement strategies of safety protocols or maybe, to help provide better advise for drivers during critical weather conditions through existing communication technology like apps.
