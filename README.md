## Introduction/ Business Problem
Seattle Police Department had been recording all types of vehicular collisions that often times lead to a loss of property and the lives of those involved. The question that can be raised here is as such-"What are the most common causes, in order to prevent road accidents from happening?". This is an attempt to understand the factors and their correlations based on data collected from 2004 to the present. With the results of the analysis, preventive measures could be introduced to the SPD for better enforcement strategies of safety protocols or maybe, to help provide better advise for drivers during critical weather conditions through existing communication technology like apps.

## Data
Upon conducting initial data understanding analysis based on the business problem defined above, the extensive data set from the SPD with over 190,000 observaions collected, I had concluded that we should be using the following attributes to accurately build a model to prevent future accidents and reduce their severity. The attributes are:
1) ADDRTYPE
2) WEATHER
3) ROADCOND
4) VEHCOUNT
5) PERSONCOUNT

In order to build the model and conduct exploratory data analysis, I will be relying on Jupyter notebooks with Python libraries imported- Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
